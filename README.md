# MLOps Demo Project

(Project Ongoing...)

The purpose of the repository is to demostrate my mastery skill-sets in Machine Learning Ops. The Coverage would be:

- Basic Data Engineering: Python, ETL, database management(SQL and NoSQL) and datapiplines (Batch and Streaming).

- Big Data Frameworks: Build and manage Spark/Hadoop clusters.

- Containeriztion and orchestration: Docker, Docker-compose, Kubernetes and Helm Charts.

- CI/CD workflows: CirleCI, Argo CD (for Kubernetes).

- Machine Learning and analytics: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, pySpark, Spark ML, H2O.ai, Dataiku. 

- ML workflow management: Airflow, MLflow and KubefLow.

- Model Deployment and API services: Flask with Gunicorn.





Future improvements:

- Version control: docker image tags, helm charts versions
